This is a systems pharmacology model of the mammalian circadian clock
including PF-670462 developed in the paper:

Jae Kyoung Kim, Daniel B Forger, Michael Marconi, Douglas Wood, Angela
Doran, Travis Wager, Cheng Chang, and Kevin M Walton (2013) "Modeling
and validating chronic pharmacological manipulation of circadian
rhythms", CPT: Pharmacometrics & Systems Pharmacology.

The model is available in the format of Mathematica.

This model is largely based on the detailed model of the mammalian
circadian clock in the paper:

Jae Kyoung Kim and Daniel B. Forger (2012) "A mechanism for robust
circadian timekeeping via balanced stoichiometry", Molecular Systems
Biology

The original model is available from the ModelDB (Access code:
145801).
